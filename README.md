## Project description: Algorithms for Prediction of Bank Marketing Campaigns

### Dataset:

Used a dataset of bank marketing with 45211 instances to predict whether a client will subscribe a term deposit based on 20 features.

The dataset can be found at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing

### Project description:

The main parts of this project are listed below:

- After data cleaning and encoding, conducted EDA on our dataset to gain an overall understanding; 
- Used data replication method to solve the imbalanced data problem
- After dataset splitting, used Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to design algorithm; 

- After hyperparameter tuning, evaluated our models according to accuracy, precision, recall, F1 Score, and AUC

### Results:

Achieved 92% accuracy and 95% AUC score.
